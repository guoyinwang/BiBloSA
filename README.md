# Experiments Codes for Bi-directional Block Self-attention
* This repo is the code of paper *title*, <http://>
* The deep learning framework is [Tensorflow/TF](https://www.tensorflow.org) 1.3 (compatible with 1.2 and 1.2.1)
* Please contact author or open an issue for questions and suggestions

## Overall Requirements
* Python3 (verified on 3.5.2, or Anaconda3 4.2.0)
* tensorflow>=1.2
* Numpy

## This repo includes following parts:
* We provide an universal interface for sequence encoding layers, which includes the proposed Bi-directional Block Self-Attention Network (Bi-BloSAN), Directional Self-Attention Network(DiSAN), CNN, Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, Bi-SRU and Multi-head attention, as well as the corresponding context fusion models.
* The experiments code on various benchmarks, i.e., Stanford Natural Language Inference, SICK, simplified SQuAD, TREC question-type classification, fine-grained/binary Stanford Sentiment Treebank, Customer Reviews, MPQA and SUBJ.



## Usage of The Universal Interface for Context Fusion and Sentence Encoding
The codes are stored in directory **context_fusion** of this repo, and just import the functions from package **context_fusion** if you want to use them:

    from context_fusion.interface import context_fusion_layers, sentence_encoding_models

These two functions share the similar parameter definitions:

* param **rep_tensor**: [tf Float 3D Tensor] The rank must be 3, i.e., [batch_size, seq_len, feature_dim];
* param **rep_mask**: [tf Bool 2D Tensor] The mask for input with rank 2: [batch_size, seq_len];
* param **method**: [str] different methods supported by context fusion and sentence encoding, which will be introduced below table.
* param **activation_function**: [str] in (relu|elu|slu)
* param **scope**: [str] The name of Tensorflow variable scope
* param **wd**: [float >= 0] if wd>0, add related tensor to tf collectoion "weight_decay" for further l2 decay
* param **is_train**: [tf Bool Scalar] the indicator of training or test.
* param **keep_prob**: [float] dropout keep probability
* param **hn**: [int/None] hidden units num, if None, the hn is same to the input feature dim in some methods.
* **other**: if the **method** is set to block, we can add `block_len=5` to specify the length of block in Bi-BloSA.

### Shared Python Parameters to Run the Experiments Codes
Here, we introduce the **shared parameters** which appear in all these benchmark projects:

* `--network_type`: [str] use "exp_context_fusion" for reproduce our experiments
* `--log_period`: [int] step period to save the summary
* `--eval_period`: [int] step period to evaluate the model on dev dataset;

* `--model_dir_suffix`: [str] a name for the model dir (the model dir is a part of programming framework which will be introduced latter);
* `--num_steps`: [int] the training step for mini-batch SGD;
* `--train_batch_size`: [int] training batch size

* `--dropout`: [float] dropout keep probability;

* `--block_len`: [None or int] if `context_fusion_method` is set to block, the int block len is the parameter for Bi-BloSA. if the block_len is None, the program will invoke a function to calculate the block len according to the dataset characteristics automatically.


### Programming Framework for all Experiments Codes
We first demonstrate the file directory tree of all these projects:

```
ROOT
--dataset[d]
----glove[d]
----$task_dataset_name$[d]
--src[d]
----model[d]
------template.py[f]
------context_fusion.py[f]
----nn_utils[d]
----utils[d]
------file.py[f]
------nlp.py[f]
------record_log.py[f]
------time_counter.py[f]
----dataset.py[f]
----evaluator.py[f]
----graph_handler.py[f]
----perform_recorder.py[f]
--result[d]
----processed_data[d]
----model[d]
------$model_specific_dir$[d]

--------log_files[d]
--------summary[d]
--------answer[d]
--configs.py[f]
--$task$_main.py[f]
--$task$_log_analysis.py[f]
```

Note: The result dir will appear after the first running.

We elaborate on the every files[f] and directory[d] as follows:

`./configs.py`: perform the parameters parsing and definitions and declarations of global variables, e.g., parameter definition/default value, name(of train/dev/test_data, model, processed_data, ckpt etc.) definitions, directories(of data, result, `$model_specific_dir$` etc.) definitions and corresponding paths generation. 

`./$task$_main.py`: this is the main entry python script to run the project;

`./$task$_log_analysis.py`: this provides a function to analyze the log file of training process. 

`./dataset/`ï¼š this is the directory including datasets for current project.

* `./dataset/glove`: including pre-trained glove file
* `./dataset/$task_dataset_name$/`: This is the dataset dir for current task, we will concretely introduce this in each project dir.

`./src`: dir including python scripts

* `./src/dataset.py`: a class to process raw data from dataset, including data tokenization, token dictionary generation, data digitization, neural network data generation. In addition, there are also some method: `generate_batch_sample_iter` for random mini-batch iteration, `get_statistic` for sentence length statistics and a interface for deleting samples with long sentence in training data.
* `./src/evaluator.py`: a class for model evaluation.
* `./src/graph_handler.py`: a class for handling graph: session initialization, summary saving, model restore etc.
* `./src/perform_recoder.py`: a class to save top-n dev accuracy model checkpoint for future loading.
* `./src/model/`: the dir including tensorflow model file
* `./src/model/template.py`: a abstract python class, including network placeholders, global tensorflow tensor variables, TF loss function, TF accuracy function, EMA for learnable variables and summary, training operation, feed dict generation and training step function. 
* `./src/model/context_fusion.py`: Main TF neural network model, implement the abstract interface `build_network` inheriting from `template.py`.
* `./src/nn_utils/`: a package include various tensorflow layers implemented by this repo author.
* `./src/utils/file.py`: file I/O functions.
* `./src/utils/nlp.py`: natural language processing functions.
* `./src/utils/record_log.py`: a log recorder class, and a corresponding instance for all use in current project.
* `./src/utils/time_counter.py`: time counter class to collect the training time, note this time exclude the process to prepare data but only the time spending in training step.

`./result/`: a dir to place the results.

* `./result/processed_data/`: a dir to place Dataset instance with pickle format. The file name is generated by `get_params_str` in `./config.py` according to the related parameters.
* `./result/model/$model_specific_dir$/`: the name of this dir is generated by `get_params_str` in `./config.py` according to the related parameters, to save the result for a combination of the parameters. In other words, we associate a dir for a combination of the parameters.
* `./result/model/$model_specific_dir$/ckpt/`: a dir to save top-n model checkpoints.
* `./result/model/$model_specific_dir$/log_files/`: a dir to save log file.
* `./result/model/$model_specific_dir$/summary/`: a dir to save tensorboard summary and tensorflow graph meta files.
